	**Document Object Model -- The DOM is a combination of your HTML, CSS, and Javascript files. This 	combination is represented as nodes organized as a tree structure. This tree structure and 	parent/child relationships makes sense to me and are pretty easy to conceptualize. However, 	being new to HTML, CSS, and DOM, DOM is confusing at the moment for the fact that I still 	don't have a full grasp of HTML or CSS on their own :/**

	**Additional resources -- I read this wikipedia article on DOM. Helped clear things up a bit 	[Document Object Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model)**
	
	**The biggest difference I noticed between the wordpress sites and my own site when using Chrome Web Tools was the fact that my own site does not utilize Javascript, while the wordpress sites do. I think the only category my site wins in is speed! My site loaded in 418ms, while it took the wordpress site 5.47s to load. This is the site I was testing [God, Drugs, and Thugs](http://goddrugsandthugs.com/2014/04/07/god-drugs-and-thugs-my-messy-beautiful/)**
	
	**To be honest, at first I found Chrome Web Tools a bit of a pain. It just didn't feel very user-friendly. The more and more I use it, though, the more I'm liking it. The PageSpeed add-on is also pretty dang nifty, since it basically prioritizes the most important issues to fix to increase the load speed of your page**
	
	**The concept of changing and updating a CSS file using Chrome Web Tools was solidified for me when I made changes to my [GitHub Homepage](http://spencerolson.github.io/). It was a great experience to learn how to alter the CSS file in-browser using Chrome Web Tools, save the updated CSS file to my local drive, and then push the changes from my local drive to the remote repository.**
	
	**I had some troubles at first when I was trying to change the :hover color using Chrome Web Tools. It took me a while to figure out that I needed to click on the file link for the full CSS file and then edit the :hover color, as opposed to editing the information directly from the 'Elements' tab. New skills -- I learned how to use a markdown editor while writing this reflection. I'm using Mou, thanks to a tip from one of the other DevBootcamp students. My favorite part of the challenge was getting to use my new knowledge of Chrome Web Tools to alter my GitHub Homepage. My least favorite part was skimming through the tutorials about Javascript debugging (a topic that next week we'll be looking closer at) -- it was information overload since I'm already learning so many other new concepts right now.**
