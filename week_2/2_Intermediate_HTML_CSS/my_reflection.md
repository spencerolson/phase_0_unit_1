# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?

** I think web standards are good. By having web standards in place, there is consistency when it comes to HMTL and CSS. Without standards, everyone would be doing things differently. Also, having standards helps with the problem of pages looking different on different devices.**

* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?

**Yes, for the most part. The \<head>, \<title>, and \<body> sections make sense to me. Sometimes I get confused with the \<title> section and think of it as representing the header of the webpage, but for the most part the standard structure is straightforward.**

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?

**I do like them. From the get-go, I thought it seemed unnecessary to have the div statements to break the HTML code into different sections. \<header>, \<footer>, and \<nav> not only clean the code up and get rid of unneeded \<div> tags, but also make it more readable.**

* Why is reset.css necessary? 

**A reset.css file is necessary to make your webpage look consistent across multiple browsers. Each browser has its own default 'user agent' stylesheet, that it uses to make unstyled websites appear more legible. By using the reset.css file, we can overwrite that default stylesheet, and make the webpage look as similar as possible across browsers.**

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?

**I have used Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari, Firefox, and Google Chrome. I have noticed that sites look different in different browsers. I think this is bad because the creator of the site has a specific style in mind for the site, and wants the site to look that way for each user, regardless of their browser choice.**

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

**I used this site to read about HTML structure [w3.org](http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html) and this site to help me understand the importance of the reset.CSS file [cssreset.com](http://www.cssreset.com/what-is-a-css-reset/).**
