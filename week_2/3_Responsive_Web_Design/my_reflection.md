# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?

**Responsive web design is a design concept where, instead of creating a finite number of 'versions' of your site for multiple platforms (e.g. a desktop site and a mobile site), you can build your page on a fluid foundation and have it adapt to the unique device and/or browser it's being viewed on.**

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?

**Smartphones and tablets have changed the web design game in that there are no longer two ways to view a site (desktop and mobile). With so many different types of devices with varying dimensions and browsers, web sites need to adapt and look nice no matter how they're being viewed. This means the concept of the static web site will probably go away.**

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?

**Visually impaired people use the web by using programs that read the content of the page to them. We should design and develop pages with visually impaired and audibly impaired users in mind.**

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?

**The concept of having a web site respond to the device it's on, rather than being static, has definitely resonated with me. Last week, when I was creating my homepage, I was getting so frustrated with the .CSS part of it because I had to keep changing pixel widths and heights. I kept thinking to myself, 'there has to be a better way to do this'. Sure enough, by having the .css file use em units and by using media queries, you can make your webpage more responsive to multiple devices.**

**The device emulation and user agent spoofing in Chrome Dev Tools still does not make sense to me. I can't get it to truly emulate how a page would look on, for example, an iPhone 5. When I attempt to emulate the iPhone 5 on DevTools, it doesn't look how I would expect it to, yet when I *actually* visit the site on my iPhone 5, it looks correct.**
