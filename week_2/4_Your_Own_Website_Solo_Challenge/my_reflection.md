# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

**My website: [spencerolson.github.io](http://spencerolson.github.io)**

Discuss the following:

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 

**Simpler is better! Don't overcomplicate things if you don't need to. I also learned a lot about positioning, especially fixed positioning while I was creating the footer bar on my site. I also learned how to round-out boxes so there aren't sharp edges. Finally, I learned that making the site as interactive and responsive to the user as possible is great -- it makes your page feel more 'alive' when colors change upon hover, clicking, etc.**

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

**I loved it! I'm addicted to messing with the design. The only part that I did not enjoy was trying to get positioning figured out. I still haven't fully grasped relative, vs. absolute vs. fixed and how they all play together; in time I'll figure it out, I guess. I also liked working on the wireframe; it's nice to get your ideas down on paper and get some type of structure before you dive in. My actual site did not end up looking exactly like my wireframe, but the wireframe was a great place to start.**

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?

**I tackled the site section by section, and it worked well for me. I first created necessary classes and IDs for the header section of the site, then for the main content, and then for the footer with links. I first had planned to do all of the class and ID definitions first, and then mess around with organization, but that was a terrible idea...**

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?

**I'm still having issues with my email icon/link. It's not actually opening up an email. So, I need to fix that. I also need to add some more content on the page; it looks a little empty right now.**

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?

**It was much easier applying what I learned this week compared to last week! Now that I have a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, I'm able to integrate new tricks I learn along the way easier than I could last week. I did some research on rounding out the edges on boxes using border-radius, and I thought that was pretty cool.**

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
