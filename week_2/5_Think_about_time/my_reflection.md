# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

**My biggest time management challenge during Phase 0 is the fact that I'm working full time. Typically, I use my weekends to get chores done, grocery shop, check things off my to-do list, and relax. Now, I spend about half of my weekend working on devbootcamp material.**

* How will you combat that? 

**I am going to put in at least an hour or two of work every weeknight, no matter what. Yes, I will be tired after work, and yes, I will want to relax, but by working a few hours each weekday I'll be able to give myself some free time for the weekend.**

* What techniques will you try?

**I'm going to give the Pomodoro Technique a shot. This way I can hopefully be more efficient with the limited time I have to study. Also, it should help reduce the number of times I hit a mental roadblock when doing work.**

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

**Work as hard as I can, while still being conscious that I need to respect myself and give myself breaks, get out, still be social, etc. I plan to communicate with the other cohorts as much as I can, so that we can all reach out to each other for help and work as a team. I've already found that meetups help immensely and stop you from feeling like you're the only one that doesn't understand certain topics.**
