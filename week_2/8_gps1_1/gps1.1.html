        <p><b>Peer programming:</b> Pair programming is an agile software
        development technique in which two programmers
        work together at one workstation. It is 
        comprised of a Driver and Navigator.

    <p><b>Why is peer programming important?</b><br>
        On demand, the two programmers can brainstorm any challenging problem. Because the two programmers periodically switch roles, they work together as equals to develop software. This practice of pair programming can be integrated into any software development process. As an example, this paper describes the changes that were made to the Personal Software Process (PSP) to leverage the power of two programmers working together, thereby formulating the Collaborative Software Process (CSP).
