// I want to create a function called sum that gives me the sum of a group of numbers.

// I want to create a function called mean that gives me the average of a group of numbers.

// I want to create a function called median that gives me the median value of a group of numbers.

//Reflection

// What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?
// What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
// What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?
// Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
// How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?
// Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
// Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

// To be honest, I did not have too many issues with this challenge. I was user #1, so I created the user stories for the next person to create pseudocode from. The hardest part of creating the user stories was avoiding using programmer jargon, e.g. array or method. I would say that a skill I learned was figuring out how to explain programming jargon in 'normal people' terms. I feel confident with each of the Learning Competencies.

// What was this experience like?
// Was your group successful in passing the tests?
// What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?

// This experience was enjoyable. At the time I'm writing this reflection, I have not seen the end product, so I can't say whether or not my group was successful in passing the tests. I think the most valuable thing I learned was how to write user stories without including programmer jargon.
